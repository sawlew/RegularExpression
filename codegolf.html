        /*
            Code golf is a term used for the game of trying to express a particular program
            in as few characters as possible. Similarly, regexp golf is the practice of writing
            as tiny a regular expression as possible to match a given pattern, and only that
            pattern.
            For each of the following items, write a regular expression to test whether any
            of the given substrings occur in a string. The regular expression should match
            only strings containing one of the substrings described. Do not worry about
            word boundaries unless explicitly mentioned. When your expression works, see
            whether you can make it any smaller.
            1. car and cat
            2. pop and prop
            3. ferret, ferry, and ferrari
            4. Any word ending in ious
            5. A whitespace character followed by a period, comma, colon, or semicolon
            6. A word longer than six letters
            7. A word without the letter e (or E)
            Refer to the table in the chapter summary for help. Test each solution with
            a few test strings.
